# ParticipatoryBudgeting


"My Community" is a project of creating an internet application for public administration employees, and residents of rural towns and other small communities. The function of this application will be to support the cooperation of administrators and residents in order to realize a common mission of improving the living conditions of society. This objective will be achieved through the creation of an application supporting the "Participatory Budget" and "Local Initiative"
The first phase of the project described in this document will consist of gathering public information about subsequent participatory budgets in different cities and creating an internet application that will allow for storing, viewing and refining this data in a structured and transparent form.
